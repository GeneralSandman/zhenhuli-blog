https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst


## Description

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
[absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference)
between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**
            Input:           1        \         3        /       2        Output:    1        Explanation:    The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).    



**Note:**

  * There are at least two nodes in this BST.
  * This question is the same as 783: <https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/>
